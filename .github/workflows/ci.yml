      # Heads up!

      # 1. Execution of this script is needed to resolve `.vercel` folder from `apps/frontend/src/components/Card/SVG.js`
      # 2. This scripts removes `apps/backend/node_modules` breaking ESLint’s module resolution.
      #    Dependency installation must occur after running ./vercel-preparation.sh.
